There are more than 90 groundfish stocks that require management through annual catch limits, yet only a small fraction can be assessed through use of a population model during each 2-year assessment cycle. Prioritizing and then choosing which stocks to assess is a major decision point in groundfish management. While the process, involving weighting multiple factors to determine prioritization of stocks, is fairly well established, the suite of analyses is currently available as an offline workbook where comparing results across species can be challenging. The development of a user- friendly tool would allow for better exploration of the factors under consideration and how those factors compare across species. As an intern, working with the mentors, I was able to build a Shiny tool to turn the workbook into an interactive graphical user interface. Features included species selection and sorting and visual presentation of the prioritization factors.
